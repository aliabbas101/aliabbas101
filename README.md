<p>Hey guys, I am a Software Engineering graduate, holding an extensive experience in the field of Web Development, started as a Back-end Developer, and worked my way up in becoming a Full Stack Developer having a good hold in various web technologies and front-end frameworks, over the course of few years during my journey I also became an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, knowing the complex problems I could solve with it, I started learning and working on several projects in areas like Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, being a part of one of the fastest growing global community of software engineers and computer scientists, I realized I can contribute to this community by sharing my knowledge and experience, so I started a Youtube channel: Wennovation Academy, on which I make tutorials to help other technology enthusiasts like me, who are striving to change the world for better.</p>
