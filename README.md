<p>Hey guys, I am a Software Engineering graduate, having an extensive experience in Software Development, started my journey as a Back-end Developer, and ended up becoming Full Stack Developer getting hold of various web technologies and front-end frameworks, over the course of few years during this journey I also became an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, having expertise in software development and combining the magic of Artificial Intelligence I could to turn a crazy idea into an actual working prototype, it almost felt like a superpower to me, so I started diving deep into its foundations and worked on several projects from areas like Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, proudly being part of one of the fastest growing global community of software engineers and computer scientists and my never ending desire to contribute to this community led me to this idea of sharing my knowledge and experience with others and I started my Youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WennovationAcademy">Wennovation Academy</a>, on which I help other technology enthusiasts like me, who are striving to change the world for better.</p>
