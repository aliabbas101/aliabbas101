<p> Hey guys, I am a Software Engineering graduate, I am a Front-end Engineer by profession and fell in love with coding from the very first program I wrote, the reason I love it so much is it's potential to change the world, few years later during my journey I became an Artificial Intelligence enthusiast, coming from a software development background and getting into Artificial Intelligence only opened a door of unlimited possibilities, I could turn even the craziest idea into an actual working prototype, it almost felt like a superpower to me, I started diving deep into its foundations and worked on several projects from areas like Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing, proudly being part of one of the fastest growing global community of software engineers and computer scientists and my never ending desire to contribute to this community led me to start my own Youtube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WennovationAcademy">Wennovation Academy</a>, where I play my part by helping other technology enthusiasts like me, who are striving to change the world for better.</p>
